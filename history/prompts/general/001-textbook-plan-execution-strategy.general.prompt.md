## Prompt

Create a complete Development Plan for the project titled: "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook."

Follow the Constitution and Specification strictly. The plan must define the step-by-step execution strategy for producing the full Docusaurus-based textbook, including:

PROJECT INITIALIZATION – Verify readiness, setup repo, configure npm, Docusaurus

DOCUSAURUS SETUP – Config, theme, sidebar, Mermaid, MDX, i18n, placeholder pages

CONTENT DEVELOPMENT PHASES – 5 phases: Skeleton, Core, Enhancements, Review, Polish

FILE STRUCTURE – Exact folder layout for modules + chapters

CHAPTER WORKFLOW – Step-by-step process for each chapter

RAG + CHATBOT PREP – Placeholder structure for future integration

MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT – i18n strategy for Urdu, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish

TESTING & DEPLOYMENT – GitHub Pages pipeline + QA

COMPLETION CRITERIA – Readiness checklist for task generation

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Development Plan at specs/001-robotics-textbook/plan.md (500+ lines) defining:

**Technical Context:**
- Stack: Node.js 18+ + TypeScript 5 + Docusaurus 2.4+ + MDX
- Dependencies: @docusaurus/preset-classic, Mermaid 10.x, i18n plugin
- Platform: GitHub Pages static hosting
- Performance: Build <30s, page load <2s, Lighthouse 100

**Constraints**: Browser-only "Try It" activities; responsive mobile; WCAG 2.1 AA

**Constitution Check**: ✅ All 6 principles verified:
- Clarity First: Template enforces 2–4 line paragraphs, simple vocabulary
- Technical Accuracy: Phase 4 validation + hardware reference spreadsheet
- Structured Template: 9-component chapter template mandatory
- Progressive Complexity: Modules scaffold from Foundations → Perception → Control → AI → Real-World
- Docusaurus-Ready: MDX + i18n + Mermaid fully supported
- Engagement: Did You Know, Real-World Examples, Try It activities integrated

**7-Phase Execution:**
- Phase 0 (2 days): Project init + Docusaurus setup + npm config
- Phase 1 (1 day): Skeleton structure (18 chapter files + frontmatter)
- Phase 2 (3 days): Docusaurus config + custom React components + i18n
- Phase 3 (21 days): Core writing (all 18 chapters, ~30,000–50,000 words)
- Phase 4 (5 days): Technical review + accuracy validation
- Phase 5 (5 days): Enhancements + engagement polish
- Phase 6 (3 days): Final polish + i18n prep
- Phase 7 (1 day): Deploy to GitHub Pages + launch

**Total: ~41 days (6 weeks)**

**File Structure (Docusaurus project):**
- /docs/module-01-foundations/ through /docs/module-05-real-world/ (18 chapters total)
- /src/components/ – LanguageSelector, ChatbotWidget, AdmonitionBox, ExerciseBlock, DiagramWrapper
- /src/pages/ – About, How to Use, Chatbot placeholder, Contact
- /i18n/en|ur|hi|ar|es/ – Multilingual folder structure
- /static/img/diagrams/ – Exported Mermaid/ASCII diagrams
- docusaurus.config.js, sidebars.js, package.json configured

**Chapter Writing Workflow (each chapter):**
1. Create from template (Phase 1 ✓)
2. Write intro + learning objectives
3. Write main content (H2 sections, 2–4 line paragraphs)
4. Create diagram (Mermaid or ASCII)
5. Add 1–3 real-world examples (Tesla Bot, Boston Dynamics, etc.)
6. Add "Did You Know?" callout
7. Add key takeaways (3–5 bullets)
8. Add exercises (3–5 questions)
9. Add "Try It" activity
10. Add cross-links (≥2 per chapter)
11. Verify quality gates (clarity, accuracy, structure, rendering, engagement)

**RAG + Chatbot Prep:**
- Unique IDs added to chapter sections for chunk-level retrieval
- Placeholder components created: ChatbotWidget.tsx, /pages/chatbot.mdx
- Endpoints structure prepared for future FastAPI + Qdrant + PostgreSQL backend

**Multilingual (i18n) Strategy:**
- English: source-of-truth at /i18n/en/
- Urdu, Hindi, Arabic, Spanish: /i18n/ur|hi|ar|es/ directories prepared
- Docusaurus native i18n plugin handles routing + language toggle
- Translation guidelines + terminology mapping documented

**Success Metrics (all 8 from specification):**
- SC-001: 80%+ reader clarity (post-chapter surveys)
- SC-002: 70%+ exercise completion, 50%+ Try It participation
- SC-003: 100% technical accuracy (Phase 4 validation)
- SC-004: Zero Docusaurus build warnings
- SC-005: 100% i18n-ready; pilot chapters translated
- SC-006: 1–3 real robots per chapter
- SC-007: ≥2 cross-links per chapter
- SC-008: 22,500–54,000 words; 18 chapters

**GitHub Pages Deployment:**
- GitHub Actions workflow configured (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
- npm run deploy → automatic GitHub Pages push
- Live site verified before Phase 7 completion

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Establishes concrete 7-phase roadmap for 6-week textbook execution; phases are sequenced logically with minimal blocker dependencies; each phase produces testable deliverables

- 🧪 Tests: Build validation (Phase 0–2), chapter accuracy (Phase 4), rendering (Phase 6), deployment (Phase 7); all success criteria measurable

- 📁 Files: specs/001-robotics-textbook/plan.md (500+ lines); comprehensive scope, technical depth, phase breakdown, deliverables per phase

- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate 200+ granular tasks; chapter writing workflow templates; reviewer checklists

- 🧠 Reflection: Plan balances ambition (18 chapters, 7 phases, ~6 weeks) with realism (1 chapter/day writing phase; phases built for parallel work if staffed); critical path clear; blockers identified; rollback/rework paths documented in quality gates

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None; plan is comprehensive and addresses all user requirements

- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS – Constitution compliance verified; all technical context defined; 7 phases detailed with deliverables; success metrics aligned; deployment pipeline specified; i18n strategy clear

- Prompt variant (if applicable): Single-turn comprehensive plan generation

- Next experiment: Execute Phase 0 and Phase 1 to validate skeleton structure; then adjust Phase 3 chapter-writing workflow based on lessons learned from first 1–2 chapters
