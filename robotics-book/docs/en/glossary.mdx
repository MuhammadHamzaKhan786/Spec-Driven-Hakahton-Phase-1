# Robotics & Physical AI Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook. Terms are listed alphabetically for easy reference.

---

## A

**Accelerometer**
A sensor that measures acceleration—the rate of change of velocity. In robots, accelerometers track linear acceleration in three dimensions and help detect orientation relative to gravity.

**Actuator**
Any device that converts an electrical or pneumatic signal into physical motion. Common examples: servo motors, DC motors, pneumatic cylinders.

**Algorithm**
A step-by-step computational procedure for solving a problem. In robotics: path planning algorithms (RRT, A*), control algorithms, perception algorithms.

**Amplifier**
Electronic circuit that increases signal strength (voltage or current) without adding noise. Used in motor drivers to amplify control signals to levels sufficient for motors.

**Autonomous**
Self-governing; capable of making decisions and acting without external control. An autonomous robot operates without direct human teleoperation.

**Axis**
A reference line used to describe rotation or movement. Robots have three axes: X (forward-backward), Y (left-right), Z (up-down).

---

## B

**Baseline**
Reference measurement used for comparison. In robotics, a baseline might be a known object size used for scale estimation in vision systems.

**Behavior Tree**
Hierarchical tree structure representing robot decision-making. Contains selectors (OR logic), sequences (AND logic), and actions.

**Bias**
Systematic error in measurement or algorithm. Also refers to inherent preferences in machine learning models that can cause unfair outcomes.

**Bipedal**
Two-legged locomotion. Humans and humanoid robots are bipedal. Offers versatility (arms free) but less stability than quadrupeds.

**Boston Dynamics**
Leading robotics research company known for advanced humanoid (Atlas) and quadruped (Spot, BigDog) robots demonstrating remarkable locomotion and manipulation.

---

## C

**Center of Mass (COM)**
The average position of all mass in an object. For balance, the COM must remain within the support polygon (area enclosed by support feet) to avoid falling.

**Closed-Loop Control**
Control system using feedback to adjust outputs based on measured results. The robot measures current state, compares to goal, adjusts motors. Essential for stability and accuracy.

**Compliance**
Flexibility or "give" in a mechanical system. Compliant joints absorb impacts and conform to surfaces. Rigid joints provide precision but risk breaking on impact.

**Computer Vision**
Field of artificial intelligence focused on enabling machines to understand and interpret visual information from images or video.

**Control Loop**
Feedback cycle: sense environment → measure current state → calculate error → adjust actuators → repeat. Modern robots run control loops 1000+ times per second.

**Covariance**
Statistical measure of how two variables vary together. In Kalman filters, covariance represents uncertainty in state estimates.

---

## D

**Dead Reckoning**
Navigation by integrating movement commands (odometry) without external references. Drifts over time without external correction.

**Degrees of Freedom (DOF)**
Number of independent ways something can move. A ball joint with 3 DOF can rotate in any direction. A humanoid arm has ~7 DOF per arm.

**Depth Camera**
Camera that captures both color (RGB) and distance information (Depth). Also called RGB-D or RGBD camera. Provides 3D data for each pixel.

**Deterministic**

---

## E

**Elastic Actuator**
Actuator with intentional compliance (springs, flexible materials) between motor and load. Stores energy during impact and releases during movement, increasing efficiency.

**Encoder**
Sensor measuring rotational position or speed. Provides feedback on motor angles, essential for knowing joint positions and velocities.

**Forward Kinematics**
Calculating the position and orientation of the end-effector given all joint angles. "Given these arm joint angles, where is the hand?"

**Friction**
