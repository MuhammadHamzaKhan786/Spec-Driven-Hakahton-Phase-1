## Introduction

<!--
  MANDATORY: 100–150 words (5–10 minutes to read)
  Goal: Hook the reader with a question, story, or real-world scenario

  - Use simple language (8th-grade reading level)
  - Include 1–2 rhetorical questions to engage readers
  - Avoid jargon without explanation
  - Reference real robots/systems naturally where relevant

  Structure suggestion:
  1. What is [topic]? (Concrete definition with analogy)
  2. Why does it matter? (Real-world application)
  3. How does it work? (Technical explanation, progressive detail)
  4. How is it used in robots? (Application to real systems)
